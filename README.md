mewsh
=====

mewsh is a MEdiaWiki SHell.

mewsh is under development and is very much alpha now.




Inspired by [drush](http://drush.org/) and
[wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/), which should have been called worsh.

You might wonder, what's the use? But if you've ever used drush or
wp-cli it'll be immediately clear to you.


It's being developed by [Kasper Souren](http://guaka.org).
