mewsh
=====

**mewsh** is a MEdiaWiki SHell.

mewsh is under development and is very much alpha now.

Inspired by [drush](http://drush.org/) or
[wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/), which should have been called [worsh](http://github.com/guaka/worsh) ;)

You might wonder, what's the use? But if you've ever used drush or
wp-cli it'll be immediately clear to you.
